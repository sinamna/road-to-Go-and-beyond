# MyVersionOfRoadMapToBackend

### introduction
This is a roadmap i would take if i wanted to start over my learning path. It includes all things i considered important and stuff ina.
I divided it into several stages and it includes some topics more than just backend alone. Hope you enjoy. I'll try to keep it updated.

### baby steps

  - Data structures
    - Time complexity concept and calculation
